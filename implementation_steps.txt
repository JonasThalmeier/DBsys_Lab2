IMPORTANT STEPS IN IMPLEMENTATION

1)Predicate--> ok
2)JoinPredicate-->ok, implemented basic join, maybe we need to improve it
3)Filter--> 
        in the getChildren() method, we assume only one child, what if there are more children, how would it be possible?
        Do we need to handle cases in which we have more than one child? How do we implement all the previous methods?
        So far I simply assumed that we have only one child, if we have more we throw an exeption.
4) Join--> 
        -in getJoinField1Name and getJoinField2Name simply add t1 and t2 to identify the table

        -in getTupleDesc() simply rewrite the method of merge() tupleDesc. 
         We need to create a new structure considering all the fields of both the tables.
         We assume that all the fields have different names except the joint field. 
         Use name defined before for the join fields(that are the only ones with same names);

         -fetchNext() --> implemented a basic nested loop join. 
                          In order to improve performances, the outer loop is done on the smallest table(seen at lesson).
                          defined a new tuple desc using the previuosly defined method.
                          For example, if one tuple is {1,2,3} and the other tuple is {1,5,6},
                          joined on equality of the first column, then this returns {t1.1,2,3,t2.1,5,6}.
                          No projection implemented yet, we keep both the fields. 

        -setChildren()--> exprected exactly two children, throw an exeption if more or less than 2.
